The goal of this template is to simplify development and deployment.
It is configured with VSCODE to work with docker. It could be retrofititted to any framework or language just by modifying the docker files.

When I develop my goal is to have one docker instance that executes commands in a folder.
I should be able to move this docker image to production and just run docker-up compose up
I guess the main folder should just contain Docker file and the project source code - or microservice that does something.
